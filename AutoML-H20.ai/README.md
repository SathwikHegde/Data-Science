#  AutoML H20.aiâ€“ Employee Future Prediction

### Build an AutoML library like H2O.ai to create predictive models and interpret them. Find a significant relation for each algorithm of the data. Create multivariate models.

While creating our model using AutoML and answer the following questions. We make use of Tables, graphs, and charts must support your evaluation 


1) Is the relationship significant?

2) Is the relationship significant?

3) Are any model assumptions violated?

4) Is there any multicollinearity in the model?

5) In the multivariate models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

6) In in multivariate models rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones from the model.

7) Does the model make sense?

8) Does regularization help?

9) Which independent variables are significant?

10) Which hyperparameters are important?
