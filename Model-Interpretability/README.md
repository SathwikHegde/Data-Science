# Model Interpretability

Interpret your models.

1. Fit a linear model and interpret the regression coefficients

2. Fit a tree-based model and interpret the nodes

3. Use auto ml to find the best model

4. Run SHAP analysis on the models from steps 1, 2, and 3

5. Interpret the SHAP values and compare them with the other model interpretability methods
